       "'The founder and majority owner of Insys Therapeutics Inc was arrested today and charged with leading a nationwide conspiracy to profit by using bribes and fraud to cause the illegal distribution of a Fentanyl spray intended for cancer patients experiencing breakthrough pain More than Americans died of synthetic opioid overdoses last year and millions are addicted to opioids And yet some medical professionals would rather take advantage of the addicts than try to help them said Attorney General Jeff Sessions This Justice Department will not tolerate this We will hold accountable anyone from street dealers to corporate executives who illegally contributes to this nationwide epidemic And under the leadership of President Trump we are fully committed to defeating this threat to the American people John N Kapoor of Phoenix Ariz a current member of the Board of Directors of Insys was arrested this morning in Arizona and charged with RICO conspiracy as well as other felonies including conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and conspiracy to violate the Anti Kickback Law Kapoor the former Executive Chairman of the Board and CEO of Insys will appear in federal court in Phoenix today He will appear in U S District Court in Boston at a later date The superseding indictment unsealed today in Boston also includes additional allegations against several former Insys executives and managers who were initially indicted in December The superseding indictment charges that Kapoor Michael L Babich of Scottsdale Ariz former CEO and President of the company Alec Burlakoff of Charlotte N C former Vice President of Sales Richard M Simon of Seal Beach Calif former National Director of Sales former Regional Sales Directors Sunrise Lee of Bryant City Mich and Joseph A Rowan of Panama City Fla and former Vice President of Managed Markets Michael J Gurry of Scottsdale Ariz conspired to bribe practitioners in various states many of whom operated pain clinics in order to get them to prescribe a fentanyl based pain medication The medication called Subsys is a powerful narcotic intended to treat cancer patients suffering intense breakthrough pain In exchange for bribes and kickbacks the practitioners wrote large numbers of prescriptions for the patients most of whom were not diagnosed with cancer The indictment also alleges that Kapoor and the six former executives conspired to mislead and defraud health insurance providers who were reluctant to approve payment for the drug when it was prescribed for non cancer patients They achieved this goal by setting up the reimbursement unit which was dedicated to obtaining prior authorization directly from insurers and pharmacy benefit managers In the midst of a nationwide opioid epidemic that has reached crisis proportions Mr Kapoor and his company stand accused of bribing doctors to overprescribe a potent opioid and committing fraud on insurance companies solely for profit said Acting United States Attorney William D Weinreb Today s arrest and charges reflect our ongoing efforts to attack the opioid crisis from all angles We must hold the industry and its leadership accountable just as we would the cartels or a street level drug dealer As alleged these executives created a corporate culture at Insys that utilized deception and bribery as an acceptable business practice deceiving patients and conspiring with doctors and insurers said Harold H Shaw Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Boston Field Division The allegations of selling a highly addictive opioid cancer pain drug to patients who did not have cancer make them no better than street level drug dealers Today s charges mark an important step in holding pharmaceutical executives responsible for their part in the opioid crisis The FBI will vigorously investigate corrupt organizations with business practices that promote fraud with a total disregard for patient safety These Insys executives allegedly fueled the opioid epidemic by paying doctors to needlessly prescribe an extremely dangerous and addictive form of fentanyl said Phillip Coyne Special Agent in Charge for the Office of Inspector General of the U S Department of Health and Human Services Corporate executives intent on illegally driving up profits need to be aware they are now squarely in the sights of law

       "      <td>The Department of Justice announced that this morning John W. Ng, 58, of Albuquerque, N.M., made his initial appearance in federal court on a criminal complaint charging him with a hate crime offense.  This charge is related to anti-Semitic threats Ng made against a Jewish woman who owns and operates the Nosh Jewish Delicatessen and Bakery in Albuquerque. Ng was arrested by the FBI on March 7, 2014, based on a criminal complaint alleging that he interfered with the victim’s federally protected rights by threatening her and interfering with her business because of her religion.  According to the criminal complaint, between Jan. 22, 2014, and Feb. 8, 2014, Ng allegedly posted threatening anti-Semitic notes on and in the vicinity of the victim’s business. A criminal complaint merely establishes probable cause, and Ng is presumed innocent unless proven guilty.  If convicted on the offense charged in the criminal complaint, Ng faces a maximum statutory penalty of one year in prison. This matter was investigated by the Albuquerque Division of the FBI and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark T. Baker of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Mexico and Trial Attorney AeJean Cha of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division.</td>\n",

       "      <td>In a nine-count indictment unsealed today, two Mississippi correctional officers were charged with beating an inmate and a third was charged with helping to cover it up.  The indictment charged Lawardrick Marsher, 28, and Robert Sturdivant, 47, officers at Mississippi State Penitentiary, in Parchman, Mississippi, with a beating that included kicking, punching and throwing the victim to the ground.  Marsher and Sturdivant were charged with violating the right of K.H., a convicted prisoner, to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.  Sturdivant was also charged with failing to intervene while Marsher was punching and beating K.H.  The indictment alleges that their actions involved the use of a dangerous weapon and resulted in bodily injury to the victim. A third officer, Deonte Pate, 23, was charged along with Marsher and Sturdivant for conspiring to cover up the beating.  The indictment alleges that all three officers submitted false reports and that all three lied to the FBI. If convicted, Marsher and Sturdivant face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison on the excessive force charges.  Each of the three officers faces up to five years in prison on the conspiracy and false statement charges, and up to 20 years in prison on the false report charges. An indictment is merely an accusation, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. This case is being investigated by the FBI’s Jackson Division, with the cooperation of the Mississippi Department of Corrections.  It is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Coleman of the Northern District of Mississippi and Trial Attorney Dana Mulhauser of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section.     Marsher Indictment</td>\n",

       "      <td>John Hall, 27, an Aryan Brotherhood member and inmate at the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) in Seagoville, Texas, was sentenced today by U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor after pleading guilty to violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act stemming from his assault of a fellow inmate, whom he believed to be gay, the Department of Justice announced. Hall assaulted his fellow inmate with a dangerous weapon, causing bodily injury to the victim on Dec. 20, 2011. Hall was sentenced to serve 71 months in prison to be served consecutively with the sentence he is currently serving. The assault occurred on Dec. 20, 2011, inside the FCI Seagoville when Hall targeted and attacked the victim, a fellow inmate, because he believed the victim was gay or involved in a sexual relationship with another male inmate. Hall repeatedly punched, kicked and stomped on the victim’s face with his shod feet, a dangerous weapon, while yelling a homophobic slur. The victim lost consciousness during the assault and suffered multiple lacerations to his face. The victim also sustained a fractured eye socket, lost a tooth, fractured other teeth and was treated at a hospital for the injuries he sustained during Hall’s unprovoked attack. Hall pleaded guilty to violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act on Nov. 8, 2012. “Brutality and violence based on sexual orientation has no place in a civilized society,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “The Justice Department is committed to using all the tools in our law enforcement arsenal, including the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, to prosecute acts motivated by hate.” “This prosecution sends a clear message that this office, in partnership with attorneys in the department’s Civil Rights Division, will prioritize and aggressively prosecute hate crimes and others civil rights violations in North Texas,” said U.S. Attorney Sarah R. Saldaña of the Northern District of Texas. This case was investigated by the FBI Dallas Division. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Errin Martin and Trial Attorney Adriana Vieco of the Civil Rights Division.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON – The Justice Department announced today that Sean Popejoy, 19, of Green Forest, Ark., pleaded guilty in federal court to one count of committing a federal hate crime and one count of conspiring to commit a federal hate crime. This is the first conviction for a violation of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which was enacted in October 2009.   Information presented during the plea hearing established that in the early morning hours of June 20, 2010, Popejoy admitted that he was part of a conspiracy to threaten and injure five Hispanic men who had pulled into a gas station parking lot.  The co-conspirators pursued the victims in a truck. When the co-conspirators caught up to the victims, Popejoy leaned outside of the front passenger window and waived a tire wrench at the victims and continued to threaten and hurl racial epithets at the victims. The co-conspirator rammed into the victims' car, which caused the victims’ car to cross the opposite lane of traffic, go off the road, crash into a tree and ignite. As a result of the co-conspirators’ actions, the victims suffered bodily injury, including one victim who sustained life-threatening injuries. “James Byrd, Jr. and Matthew Shepard were brutally murdered more than a decade ago, and today the first defendant is convicted for a hate crime under the critical new law enacted in their names,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “It is unacceptable that violent acts of hate committed because of someone’s race continue to occur in 2011, and the department will continue to use every available tool to identify and prosecute hate crimes whenever and wherever they occur.  “It is terrible and disturbing that violence motivated by hatred of another’s race continues to occur,” said Conner Eldridge, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas. “We are committed to prosecuting such crimes in the Western District of Arkansas.” If convicted, the defendant faces a maximum punishment of 15 years in prison. This case is being investigated by the FBI’s Fayetteville Division in cooperation with the Arkansas State Police Department and the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office.   The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Edward Chung of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Kyra Jenner for the Western District of Arkansas.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Chase McClary, 23, of Johnsonville, S.C., pleaded guilty today in federal court in the District of South Carolina to violating the Matthew Shepard-James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act in his violent assault of an African-American teenager. During his guilty plea, McClary admitted that in August 2010, he approached a 16-year-old African-American male and struck him numerous times with the jagged end of a broken coffee mug because of the victim’s race. The attack resulted in severe injuries to the victim’s head, face and neck. Sentencing will be set at a later date. The plea agreement calls for a sentence of 48 months in prison. “Motivated by hate, the defendant attacked a teenager and scarred him for life. No one should have to endure such an abhorrent act of criminal violence,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney for the Civil Rights Division. “The Justice Department will vigorously prosecute cases of bias motivated violence to the full extent of the law.” “Prosecution of hate-based crime – whether the motive is the color of skin, sexua l orientation, religion, gender or national origin – is critical to the American way of life and the justice system,” said U.S. Attorney Bill Nettles for the District of South Carolina. I want to thank the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the F lorence County Sheriff’s Office and Ed Clements, the Thirteenth Circuit Solicitor, for their work on this civil rights case.”  This case was investigated by Special Agent Steven Stokes of the FBI, with assistance from the Florence County Sheriff’s Investigator Alvin Powell, and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Brad Parham and Civil Rights Division Trial Attorney Christopher Lomax.</td>\n",

Ng, 58, of Albuquerque, N.M., made his initial appearance in federal court on a criminal complaint charging him with a hate crime offense.  This charge is related to anti-Semitic threats Ng made against a Jewish woman who owns and operates the Nosh Jewish Delicatessen and Bakery in Albuquerque. Ng was arrested by the FBI on March 7, 2014, based on a criminal complaint alleging that he interfered with the victim’s federally protected rights by threatening her and interfering with her business because of her religion.  According to the criminal complaint, between Jan. 22, 2014, and Feb. 8, 2014, Ng allegedly posted threatening anti-Semitic notes on and in the vicinity of the victim’s business. A criminal complaint merely establishes probable cause, and Ng is presumed innocent unless proven guilty.  If convicted on the offense charged in the criminal complaint, Ng faces a maximum statutory penalty of one year in prison. This matter was investigated by the Albuquerque Division of the FBI and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark T. Baker of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Mexico and Trial Attorney AeJean Cha of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division.   \n",

A third officer, Deonte Pate, 23, was charged along with Marsher and Sturdivant for conspiring to cover up the beating.  The indictment alleges that all three officers submitted false reports and that all three lied to the FBI. If convicted, Marsher and Sturdivant face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison on the excessive force charges.  Each of the three officers faces up to five years in prison on the conspiracy and false statement charges, and up to 20 years in prison on the false report charges. An indictment is merely an accusation, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. This case is being investigated by the FBI’s Jackson Division, with the cooperation of the Mississippi Department of Corrections.  It is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Coleman of the Northern District of Mississippi and Trial Attorney Dana Mulhauser of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section.     Marsher Indictment   \n",

Hall assaulted his fellow inmate with a dangerous weapon, causing bodily injury to the victim on Dec. 20, 2011. Hall was sentenced to serve 71 months in prison to be served consecutively with the sentence he is currently serving. The assault occurred on Dec. 20, 2011, inside the FCI Seagoville when Hall targeted and attacked the victim, a fellow inmate, because he believed the victim was gay or involved in a sexual relationship with another male inmate. Hall repeatedly punched, kicked and stomped on the victim’s face with his shod feet, a dangerous weapon, while yelling a homophobic slur. The victim lost consciousness during the assault and suffered multiple lacerations to his face. The victim also sustained a fractured eye socket, lost a tooth, fractured other teeth and was treated at a hospital for the injuries he sustained during Hall’s unprovoked attack. Hall pleaded guilty to violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act on Nov. 8, 2012. “Brutality and violence based on sexual orientation has no place in a civilized society,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “The Justice Department is committed to using all the tools in our law enforcement arsenal, including the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, to prosecute acts motivated by hate.” “This prosecution sends a clear message that this office, in partnership with attorneys in the department’s Civil Rights Division, will prioritize and aggressively prosecute hate crimes and others civil rights violations in North Texas,” said U.S. Attorney Sarah R. Saldaña of the Northern District of Texas. This case was investigated by the FBI Dallas Division. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Errin Martin and Trial Attorney Adriana Vieco of the Civil Rights Division.   \n",
       "22   WASHINGTON – The Justice Department announced today that Sean Popejoy, 19, of Green Forest, Ark., pleaded guilty in federal court to one count of committing a federal hate crime and one count of conspiring to commit a federal hate crime. This is the first conviction for a violation of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which was enacted in October 2009.   Information presented during the plea hearing established that in the early morning hours of June 20, 2010, Popejoy admitted that he was part of a conspiracy to threaten and injure five Hispanic men who had pulled into a gas station parking lot.  The co-conspirators pursued the victims in a truck. When the co-conspirators caught up to the victims, Popejoy leaned outside of the front passenger window and waived a tire wrench at the victims and continued to threaten and hurl racial epithets at the victims. The co-conspirator rammed into the victims' car, which caused the victims’ car to cross the opposite lane of traffic, go off the road, crash into a tree and ignite. As a result of the co-conspirators’ actions, the victims suffered bodily injury, including one victim who sustained life-threatening injuries. “James Byrd, Jr. and Matthew Shepard were brutally murdered more than a decade ago, and today the first defendant is convicted for a hate crime under the critical new law enacted in their names,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “It is unacceptable that violent acts of hate committed because of someone’s race continue to occur in 2011, and the department will continue to use every available tool to identify and prosecute hate crimes whenever and wherever they occur.  “It is terrible and disturbing that violence motivated by hatred of another’s race continues to occur,” said Conner Eldridge, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas. “We are committed to prosecuting such crimes in the Western District of Arkansas.” If convicted, the defendant faces a maximum punishment of 15 years in prison. This case is being investigated by the FBI’s Fayetteville Division in cooperation with the Arkansas State Police Department and the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office.   The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Edward Chung of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division and Assistant U.S. Attorney Kyra Jenner for the Western District of Arkansas.   \n",

During his guilty plea, McClary admitted that in August 2010, he approached a 16-year-old African-American male and struck him numerous times with the jagged end of a broken coffee mug because of the victim’s race. The attack resulted in severe injuries to the victim’s head, face and neck. Sentencing will be set at a later date. The plea agreement calls for a sentence of 48 months in prison. “Motivated by hate, the defendant attacked a teenager and scarred him for life. No one should have to endure such an abhorrent act of criminal violence,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney for the Civil Rights Division. “The Justice Department will vigorously prosecute cases of bias motivated violence to the full extent of the law.” “Prosecution of hate-based crime – whether the motive is the color of skin, sexua l orientation, religion, gender or national origin – is critical to the American way of life and the justice system,” said U.S. Attorney Bill Nettles for the District of South Carolina. I want to thank the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the F lorence County Sheriff’s Office and Ed Clements, the Thirteenth Circuit Solicitor, for their work on this civil rights case.”  This case was investigated by Special Agent Steven Stokes of the FBI, with assistance from the Florence County Sheriff’s Investigator Alvin Powell, and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Brad Parham and Civil Rights Division Trial Attorney Christopher Lomax.   \n",

       "      <td>A Modesto, California resident was convicted today after a 10-day jury trial on 14 child exploitation offenses for his role in a child exploitation enterprise, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and Acting U.S. Attorney Daniel L. Lemisch of the Eastern District of Michigan.   Justin Fuller, 37, a bridge maintenance supervisor for the California Department of Transportation, was found guilty of one count of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise; one count of conspiracy to produce child pornography; five counts of production of child pornography; one count of conspiracy to receive child pornography; one count of conspiracy to access with intent to view child pornography; and five counts of enticement of a minor to engage in illegal sexual activity. According to trial evidence, between Nov. 16, 2013, and March 10, 2016, Fuller and five co-conspirators located in different states worked together to lure juvenile girls to a video chat website in order to get them to engage in sexually explicit conduct.  The group members predominantly targeted prepubescent girls and would, unbeknownst to the girls, record the lured young girls performing the sexually explicit conduct.  The group was active for approximately two years and communicated with each other through “base” chatrooms that were password-protected.  In the base chat rooms, Fuller and co-conspirators strategized how to convince minor females to produce child pornography, including pretending to be teenage boys or girls to help convince the minor females to engage in sexual activity. The other five co-conspirators each pleaded guilty prior to trial to one count of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise.  On June 21, 2016, Virgil Napier, 54, of Waterford, Michigan, pleaded guilty.  On July 11, 2016, John Garrison, 52, of Glenarm, Illinois, pleaded guilty.  On Feb. 24, 2017, Thomas Dougherty, 54, of Vallejo, California, pleaded guilty.  On Sept. 23, 2016, Dantly Nicart, 39, a citizen of the Philippines residing in Las Vegas, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment followed by five years of supervised release and $150,000 in restitution on March 2, 2017.   On June 21, 2016, Brandon Henneberg, 31, of Diller, Nebraska, pleaded guilty in the District of Nebraska, and on Sept. 14, 2016, he was sentenced to 35 years imprisonment, followed by a lifetime term of supervised release and $60,000 in restitution. Trial Attorney Austin M. Berry of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney April N. Russo of the Eastern District of Michigan are prosecuting the case.  The FBI’s Detroit Field Office and Southeast Michigan Trafficking and Exploitation Crimes (SEMTEC) task force investigated the case with assistance from CEOS’s High Technology Investigative Unit. This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse, launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.  Led by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.  For more information about Project Safe Childhood, please visit http://www.justice.gov/psc.\\n</td>\n",
       "      <td>WASHINGTON – A Danish man was sentenced today in the Western District of Missouri to 30 years in prison for producing and transporting child pornography and for extortion against an 11-year-old Missouri girl, Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Beth Phillips of the Western District of Missouri announced.   Kai Lundstroem Pedersen, 61, a citizen of Denmark, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Greg Kays.  Pedersen pleaded guilty to the federal indictment on Sept. 6, 2011.   According to court documents, in July 2010, Pedersen engaged in a video web chat from his home in Denmark with an 11-year-old girl in Buchanan County, Mo., identified as Jane Doe #1.  Pedersen used a fake Facebook account to pose as a juvenile-aged male.  Pedersen admitted that he instructed the girl to engage in sexually explicit conduct that he recorded and saved as a digital video on his computer.  This video, as well as screen capture images from the video, were later edited and distributed to others, including family and friends of the victim.  Pedersen distributed the images and video over the Internet via file-sharing software.   Pedersen contacted Jane Doe #1 using various aliases through email and chat programs from July to September 2010 in an effort to convince her to engage again in sexually explicit conduct via video web chat.  Pedersen threatened to disseminate sexually explicit images of her over the Internet if she did not comply with his demands.  For example, on Aug. 15, 2010, Pedersen used nine different aliases on Facebook to contact Jane Doe #1, relaying rape and murder fantasies, asserting that various individuals had watched her video and describing the various sexual acts that these individuals wanted to perform on her.   According to court documents, in August 2010, Pedersen initiated contact with another minor female in rural Missouri, whom he believed to be a close friend of Jane Doe #1.  Pedersen contacted this victim, identified as Jane Doe #2, in an effort to exert pressure to have either Jane Doe #1 or Jane Doe #2 perform sexually explicit conduct for him via video web chat.   On Aug. 13, 2010, Jane Doe #1=s mother contacted law enforcement authorities.  The mother told an officer that she learned of the contact with Pedersen after receiving Facebook messages that contained nude images of her daughter.  A law enforcement officer, posing as a minor victim, communicated online with Pedersen and learned that he was traveling for vacation on Aug. 20, 2010.  When Pedersen logged into his Facebook account on Aug. 25, 2010, investigators were able to trace his Internet protocol address to a residence in Stonybrook, N.Y., where he was arrested on Sept. 3, 2010.   This case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick D. Daly of the Western District of Missouri and Trial Attorney Keith Becker of the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) in the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.  It was investigated by the Buchanan County, Mo., Sheriff=s Department; the Western Missouri Cyber Crimes Task Force; the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Office of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI); and CEOS.   This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice. Led by U.S. Attorneys= Offices and the Criminal Division=s CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who exploit children, as well as to identify and rescue victims.

Cronan of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and Special Agent in Charge Joseph Macias of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Los Angeles.  Paul Alan Shapiro, 71, a retired auto dealership employee, pleaded guilty one day before he was set to go on trial on July 24, 2017. Under the terms of the plea agreement, Shapiro will serve 10 years in federal prison, 20 years of supervised release following his prison sentence, and will pay $20,000 total to two victims, both of whom are citizens of the Kingdom of Thailand.  U.S. District Court Judge Dolly M. Gee of the Central District of California presided over today’s sentencing.   According to plea documents, Shapiro traveled from Los Angeles to Thailand on numerous occasions over the past 20 years, and engaged in sexual acts with male boys under the age of 16 on multiple occasions.

       "86  A Modesto, California resident was convicted today after a 10-day jury trial on 14 child exploitation offenses for his role in a child exploitation enterprise, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and Acting U.S. Attorney Daniel L. Lemisch of the Eastern District of Michigan.   Justin Fuller, 37, a bridge maintenance supervisor for the California Department of Transportation, was found guilty of one count of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise; one count of conspiracy to produce child pornography; five counts of production of child pornography; one count of conspiracy to receive child pornography; one count of conspiracy to access with intent to view child pornography; and five counts of enticement of a minor to engage in illegal sexual activity. According to trial evidence, between Nov. 16, 2013, and March 10, 2016, Fuller and five co-conspirators located in different states worked together to lure juvenile girls to a video chat website in order to get them to engage in sexually explicit conduct.  The group members predominantly targeted prepubescent girls and would, unbeknownst to the girls, record the lured young girls performing the sexually explicit conduct.  The group was active for approximately two years and communicated with each other through “base” chatrooms that were password-protected.  In the base chat rooms, Fuller and co-conspirators strategized how to convince minor females to produce child pornography, including pretending to be teenage boys or girls to help convince the minor females to engage in sexual activity. The other five co-conspirators each pleaded guilty prior to trial to one count of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise.  On June 21, 2016, Virgil Napier, 54, of Waterford, Michigan, pleaded guilty.  On July 11, 2016, John Garrison, 52, of Glenarm, Illinois, pleaded guilty.  On Feb. 24, 2017, Thomas Dougherty, 54, of Vallejo, California, pleaded guilty.  On Sept. 23, 2016, Dantly Nicart, 39, a citizen of the Philippines residing in Las Vegas, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment followed by five years of supervised release and $150,000 in restitution on March 2, 2017.   On June 21, 2016, Brandon Henneberg, 31, of Diller, Nebraska, pleaded guilty in the District of Nebraska, and on Sept. 14, 2016, he was sentenced to 35 years imprisonment, followed by a lifetime term of supervised release and $60,000 in restitution. Trial Attorney Austin M. Berry of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney April N. Russo of the Eastern District of Michigan are prosecuting the case.  The FBI’s Detroit Field Office and Southeast Michigan Trafficking and Exploitation Crimes (SEMTEC) task force investigated the case with assistance from CEOS’s High Technology Investigative Unit. This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse, launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.  Led by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.  For more information about Project Safe Childhood, please visit http://www.justice.gov/psc.\\n    \n",

       "86    WASHINGTON – A Danish man was sentenced today in the Western District of Missouri to 30 years in prison for producing and transporting child pornography and for extortion against an 11-year-old Missouri girl, Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Beth Phillips of the Western District of Missouri announced.   Kai Lundstroem Pedersen, 61, a citizen of Denmark, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Greg Kays.  Pedersen pleaded guilty to the federal indictment on Sept. 6, 2011.   According to court documents, in July 2010, Pedersen engaged in a video web chat from his home in Denmark with an 11-year-old girl in Buchanan County, Mo., identified as Jane Doe #1.  Pedersen used a fake Facebook account to pose as a juvenile-aged male.  Pedersen admitted that he instructed the girl to engage in sexually explicit conduct that he recorded and saved as a digital video on his computer.  This video, as well as screen capture images from the video, were later edited and distributed to others, including family and friends of the victim.  Pedersen distributed the images and video over the Internet via file-sharing software.   Pedersen contacted Jane Doe #1 using various aliases through email and chat programs from July to September 2010 in an effort to convince her to engage again in sexually explicit conduct via video web chat.  Pedersen threatened to disseminate sexually explicit images of her over the Internet if she did not comply with his demands.  For example, on Aug. 15, 2010, Pedersen used nine different aliases on Facebook to contact Jane Doe #1, relaying rape and murder fantasies, asserting that various individuals had watched her video and describing the various sexual acts that these individuals wanted to perform on her.   According to court documents, in August 2010, Pedersen initiated contact with another minor female in rural Missouri, whom he believed to be a close friend of Jane Doe #1.  Pedersen contacted this victim, identified as Jane Doe #2, in an effort to exert pressure to have either Jane Doe #1 or Jane Doe #2 perform sexually explicit conduct for him via video web chat.   On Aug. 13, 2010, Jane Doe #1=s mother contacted law enforcement authorities.  The mother told an officer that she learned of the contact with Pedersen after receiving Facebook messages that contained nude images of her daughter.  A law enforcement officer, posing as a minor victim, communicated online with Pedersen and learned that he was traveling for vacation on Aug. 20, 2010.  When Pedersen logged into his Facebook account on Aug. 25, 2010, investigators were able to trace his Internet protocol address to a residence in Stonybrook, N.Y., where he was arrested on Sept. 3, 2010.   This case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick D. Daly of the Western District of Missouri and Trial Attorney Keith Becker of the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) in the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.  It was investigated by the Buchanan County, Mo., Sheriff=s Department; the Western Missouri Cyber Crimes Task Force; the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Office of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI); and CEOS.   This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice. Led by U.S. Attorneys= Offices and the Criminal Division=s CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who exploit children, as well as to identify and rescue victims.

Cronan of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and Special Agent in Charge Joseph Macias of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Los Angeles.  Paul Alan Shapiro, 71, a retired auto dealership employee, pleaded guilty one day before he was set to go on trial on July 24, 2017. Under the terms of the plea agreement, Shapiro will serve 10 years in federal prison, 20 years of supervised release following his prison sentence, and will pay $20,000 total to two victims, both of whom are citizens of the Kingdom of Thailand.  U.S. District Court Judge Dolly M. Gee of the Central District of California presided over today’s sentencing.   According to plea documents, Shapiro traveled from Los Angeles to Thailand on numerous occasions over the past 20 years, and engaged in sexual acts with male boys under the age of 16 on multiple occasions. On at least two occasions in September 2012, Shapiro paid minors as young as 13 years old small amounts of local currency in order to engage in various sex acts with them. According to other documents filed in the case, Shapiro photographed these encounters of himself engaging in sexually explicit conduct with the boys. HSI conducted the investigation.  Trial Attorneys Austin M. Berry and Ralph Paradiso of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) prosecuted the case. This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse, launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.  Led by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.  For more information about Project Safe Childhood, please visit http://www.justice.gov/psc.   \n",
